This is a feedforward/backpropogation Neural network utilizing many different classes without the use of pre-made machine learning platforms. (i.e. tensorflow, pytorch) 
This Neural network uses these libraries:
- Matplotlib 
- Mlxtend
- Numpy

If the code is cloned or used, a suggestion would be to use the pycharm IDE. It keeps all the graphs in a contained queue as there are many graphs produced.

What can this thing do:

- Interactive simple terminal menu with plenty of options.
- Provides three simple datasets which are iris, Sin, XOR.
- Creates a scatterplot for training and testing Sin dataset.
- Creates a confusion matrix for testing Iris dataset.
- Allows user to test/train data
- Gives the abilities to set the amount of nodes, layers, and learning rate per layer.
- Allows the user to traverse through the layers once the graph has been.

Here is a diagram of the class structures of the neural network indicated below:
Note: Arrows indicate the inheritance.
